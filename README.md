If you have interests in machine learning/deep learning and blockchain, you should want to have a chance to implement non-trivial and decent applications for those deeply. Here is a good news. We invite you to join the 10-day long University Machine Learning & Blockchain Camp in Jeju 2020, where you can do that and have a fun and unforgettable memory with your friends from other universities. 
For the period, we will design and train a deep learning model and blockchain applications using TensorFlow, Pytorch and other frameworks from start-to-finish with your mentor. We might have access to some more mentors/experts to help you to implement your idea. We hope you get the benefit of this wonderful opportunity.
**All of you guys selected as attendees(mentors and mentees) will be provided with rooms and meals during the camp at Jeju National University in Jeju, South Korea. Round-trip airfare to Jeju Island will be covered fully for the attendees. In addition to these benefits, participants will get valuable and practical experiences in the field of machine learning/deep learning & blockchain. We look forward to your application!**
